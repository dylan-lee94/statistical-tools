Projects based on statistical analysis of Cryptocurrencies
### Mututal Information
Computing the Mutual Information of Cryptocurrency pairs and between Crytocurrency and Sentiment pairs.  Includes the calculation of p-values for MI through Permutation Tests.

### Scaling Behaviour


### Value at Risk
Calculation of VaR & CVaR with Historical Simulation, Normal Distribution, Student's t-Distribution. Computation of VaR for increasing Time Window with several methods (Parametric, Normal, Student's, EWMA). 

__To-Do List__
- [ ] VaR: Add Monte Carlo Simulation for Value at Risk
- [ ] VaR: Implement VaR Backtesting


### Distribution Fitting
Parametric and non-parametric estimation of the Body & Tail PDF of a Cryptocurreny. Includes the computation of Power Law Tail Exponents and the calculation of Confidence Intervals through Bootstrapping. 

__To-Do List__
- [ ] Kernel Density Estimation
- [ ] Tail: Fit Generalized Pareto distribution,  Generalized extreme value distribution,  Exponential Distributions
- [ ] Tail&Body: Statistical Test (Kolmogorow-Smirnow Test , Andersonâ€“Darling Test)
